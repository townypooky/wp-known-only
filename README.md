# Known Only (WordPress Plugin)
Permits only guests who has a secret word in URI.

Do you want to have your private WordPress blog ?
Known Only shuts out all unknown visitors
and you can share your contents without taking care
of your privacy !!

## Easy install
Download it on your WordPress plugin directory,
and modefy `wp-known-only.php` on the admin page.
Change `KY_KEY` and `KY_PWD` as you want.

## Note
This allows anyone's access who knows the secret word.
Once it leaks, you have to change the word and all past URIs
otherwise this won't work as you expect.

## Why, this ?
Friends are so lazy they don't register on each friend's
server and can browse "published" pages only.

Instead, SNSs are not so beautiful they don't satisfy your
writing as WordPress does.

This helps you to keep using WordPress.
